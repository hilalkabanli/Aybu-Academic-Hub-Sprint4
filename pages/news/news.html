            <p class="news-date">Date: March 23, 2024</p>
            <p class="news-description">AYBU Hippotherapy Application and Research Center organized a special event for the elderly residents coming from Abidin Yılmaz Nursing Home and Rehabilitation Center in Çubuk district as part of the annual Elderly Week celebrations. The event was aimed at supporting the physical and mental health of the elderly through activities focusing on equine therapy. Equine therapy is an effective treatment method that can provide many benefits for elderly individuals, such as reducing stress, increasing muscle strength, and improving balance. During this event, elderly participants interacted with horses, learned about horses, and enjoyed their time. Under the guidance of Hippotherapy Center Director Lecturer Ali Ekber ÜN and Instructor Burcu ÇALIK BAĞRIYANIK, students provided information to the elderly about horse living areas and demonstrated how to care for horses. Additionally, grooming materials for horses were introduced, and practical information about horse care was shared. Elderly participants took guided tours with students and experienced horseback riding. Through these activities, they both remained physically active and mentally relaxed through their interaction with the horses.</p>
